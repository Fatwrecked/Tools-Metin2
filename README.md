This a snapshop of my latest source code, switch-bot is quite a mess due to
heavy testing with latest binary.

I appreciate questions, feedback and improvements but don't be too
strict it's my first C++ project ;) I lately started to structure it a
bit...but yeah it's still a mess :D

PLEASE DON'T ASK HOW TO GET THIS TO WORK OR FOR TUTORIALS!!!
There are a lot of on YouTube
